Contributing
============

Contributions are always welcome! Please abide by the following rules when
contributing:

#. Check that no-one has opened an issue already covering your bug. If you open
   a duplicate issue, the maintainer will give you a stern look.
#. Fork the `Github repository`_ and start writing your tests. If you're fixing
   a bug, I recommend writing a failing test first and working until it passes.
   If you're adding a feature, you're free to add tests after you write the
   functionality, but please test the functionality thoroughly.
#. Send a Pull Request. If I don't respond within a couple of days, please
   shout at me on Twitter or via email until I do something about it.
